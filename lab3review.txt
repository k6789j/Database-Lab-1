Correct SQL statements
Correct output for some queries
SQL statements are somewhat readable

Recommendations: 
 To improve your readability, write queries instead of this
  SELECT *
  FROM products
  WHERE city != 'Dallas' AND city != 'Duluth' AND priceUSD >= 1;
 do it like this:
  SELECT *
  FROM products
  WHERE city != 'Dallas' 
    AND city != 'Duluth' 
    AND priceUSD >= 1;


5. List the names of agents not in New York and not in Tokyo.

Incorrect output
- You are asked to give the names only, not the city.


8. List all data for orders in February less than US$500.

Incorrect output
- It seems like you did not read the correct instructions for this query. Read
  it again, please. Hint: month?


In general: 

- Test all your SQL statements.

- Make sure you read all the instructions for queries really well.
