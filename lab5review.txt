Correct queries
Correct SQL statements
SQL statements are readable
Correct output for some queries

Recommendations: 
 To improve your readability, write queries like this:
  SELECT DISTINCT pid
  FROM orders
  WHERE aid IN (SELECT aid
                FROM orders
                WHERE cid IN (SELECT cid
                              FROM customers
                              WHERE city = 'Dallas'))
  ORDER BY pid DESC;     -- < notice the correct indentation here


2. Show the ids of products ordered through any agent who makes at least 
   one order for a customer in Dallas, sorted by pid from highest to 
   lowest. Use joins; no subqueries.

Incorrect output
- You are joining the wrong tables.


5. Show the names of customers who placed at least one order through an 
   agent in their own city, along with those agent(sâ€™) names.

Incorrect output
- Your where clause is incorrect



In general: 

- Test all your SQL statements.

- Make sure you read all the instructions for queries really well.
